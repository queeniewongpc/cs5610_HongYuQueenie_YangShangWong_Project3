## Directions

After you clone the repository, run `npm install` in the root

First, update line 29 of server.js to point to MongoDB instance (either locally or on MongoDB Atlas)

Then, open terminal to start backend: `npm run start`
(You may need to install nodemon `npm install -g nodemon`)
Open second terminal to start frontend: `npm run dev`

All backend code will be in server.js and the server directory
All frontend code will be in src directory
